# React music player

The project was created using Create React App. The main motivation was to learn basics of React, and have a minimalist music player to listen to songs I like.

Functionalities : play/stop, loop, play previous/next song, volume handle, seek to a specific time, play next song automatically, play song in random order

The site uses static JSON data taken directly from `/data/MusicList.json`

## Dependencies

The project use [react-player](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player), [rc-slider](https://github.com/react-component/slider) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
