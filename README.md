# React music player
The motivation to make this project is to avoid ads and I can listen to songs I like in 1 click.

The project is created using CRA (Create React App).

It has some basic functionality : play/stop, auto-repeat, play previous song/next song, volume handle, seek to a specific time

Data is taken from `/data/MusicList.json`, I only include old song, as I would listen to newer song directly on music platforms to support artists

## Dependencies

The project use react-player, rc-slider and material-ui, the link are below :
