# React music player
The motivation to make this project is avoid ads and I can listen to songs I like in 1 click.
Currently I'm working on a fullstack version with ASP.NET as backend

The project is created using CRA (Create React App).

It has some basic functionality : play/stop, auto-repeat, play previous song/next song, volume handle, seek to a specific time

Data is taken from `/data/MusicList.json`
