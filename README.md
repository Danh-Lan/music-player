# React Music Player

This project was created using Create React App. The main motivation was to learn the basics of React and have a minimalist music player to listen to songs I like.

Functionalities: play/stop, loop, play previous/next song, volume control, seek to a specific time, play the next song automatically, play songs in random order.

The site uses static JSON data taken directly from `/data/MusicList.json`.

## Dependencies

The project uses [react-player](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player), [rc-slider](https://github.com/react-component/slider), and [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/).
